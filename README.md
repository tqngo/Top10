//Top Ten Website

//We worked together to create a top ten website of heroes and villains. We used BootStrap components to implement a nav bar, cards, accordions, and carousel to display our visuals.

//Peer Review: Your website is really cool. I like the use of the accordians to organize the items and the carousel inside of the accordian to access the vids. Having one top ten for villains and one for heroes was a good idea and the overall graphics used on the site makes it fun to go through and look at. I only noticed two minor things that you could improve. First the title page feels like it's cut off at the bottom, so I would may add padding to the bottom of the body to try to fix that. Secondly the font used on the hero page description I found a little hard, though I know stylistically it's cool, might consider changing it. Other than really nice website. 10/10.
